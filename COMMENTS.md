# put your "I would have done this with more time"-style comments here

I ran out of time for task 4, i was trying to map through data.place for the cards but also I was trying to see how to import MUI features from their website. I could not find any installations directions on their website and the example they gave was not working. Ultimately I wish I had more time to investigate how to use https://mui.com/material-ui/react-card/
